## What Is It?

**Shuhari CyberForge™** is a community-powered cybersecurity suite written in Rust, designed to provide powerful, affordable, and educational security tools for everyday users and developers.

The name comes from **Shuhari**, a Japanese martial art concept that describes the stages of learning to mastery:
- **Shu** - Protect/obey the fundamentals
- **Ha** - Detach/break the rules to innovate
- **Ri** - Transcend the rules to create freely

This mirrors our journey: Learning security fundamentals, innovating on existing tools, and ultimately creating something new together

My goal is to build an ecosystem that rivals major security platforms like Norton and McAfee, but with:
- **Stronger transparency** - Know what your security software is doing
- **Better tools** - Modern, efficient, and actually useful
- **Community-driven philosophy** - Built by and for the people who use it

To give **Shuhari CyberForge** a unique identity, each tool will be represented by a custom anime-themed character.

## Why I'm Building This

Security software is often:
- Expensive
- Closed-off
- Bloated with features nobody asked for

I believe it can be better, more affordable, more transparent, and more feature-rich. 

**Shuhari CyberForge** is an opportunity for both myself and others to learn how real security tools work while contributing to something that could make a real impact. Even if we never rival the big players, we'll learn a ton and build something useful along the way.

## Core Pillars

**Shuhari CyberForge** is built on four principles:

1. **Community**
2. **Security**
3. **Education**
4. **Affordability**

## The Tools

### Always Free and Open Source

Four foundational tools that will always be 100% open source:

- **Shugo** - System Audit and Educator *(MVP Available Now - [ShugoREADME.md](./tools/shugo/src/ShugoREADME.md))*
- **[Name TBD]** - Malware Scanner *(In Development)*
- **[Name TBD]** - Network Security *(Planned)*
- **[Name TBD]** - Password Manager *(Planned)*

### Maybe Someday

Three additional tools I want to build, though I'm still figuring out if they're feasible or if they can be fully open source:

- **[Name TBD]** - Ransomware Protection
- **[Name TBD]** - Suspicious Activity Monitor
- **[Name TBD]** - AI...Something (I'm not sure on this one yet)

## Community Plans

If **Shuhari CyberForge** succeeds, I want to do cool stuff with the community:
- Recognition for contributors
- Future bug bounty programs
- Coding and Art competitions
- Giveaways
- And loads more

If it does really well, I'd like to make a Comedy/Educational/Action anime of **Shuhari CyberForge**. Though that's my own desire.

All of this depends on whether people actually use and care about **Shuhari CyberForge**.

## Disclaimer

**Shuhari CyberForge and all its tools are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind.**
This is experimental, educational software created by a 21 year old Cybersecurity student and community contributors. 

By using this software, you understand and agree that:
- The developer and contributors are **not liable** for any damage, data loss, or security incidents that may occur from its use.
- This software is **not a certified security product**.
- You are responsible for evaluating its suitability for your environment.

**Use at your own risk.**

## Real Talk

I'm writing this as a dream, fully aware it might never reach the success I'm imagining. **And I'm okay with that.**

I'm doing this mainly to:
- Improve my own skills
- Learn how security tools actually work
- Teach others through my mistakes and successes
- Build something useful, even if it's just for a small group

If even 100 people use **Shugo** and learn something about Windows security, that's a win.

If you believe in this vision or just want to support the work: 
- **[Star the repository](https://github.com/AnimeForLife191/Shuhari-CyberForge)** - It helps more than you know.
- **Feedback & Suggestions** - What do you want to see in these tools?
- **Submit code improvements** (all skill levels welcome!) - My code is probably worse then yours.
- **Improve Documentation** - My writing is even worse.
