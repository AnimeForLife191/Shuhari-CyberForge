# SysDefense

**Community-Powered Cybersecurity**

## What Is It?

**SysDefense** is a community-powered cybersecurity suite written in Rust, designed to provide powerful, affordable, and educational security tools for everyday users and developers.

My goal is to build an ecosystem that rivals major security platforms like Norton and McAfee, but with:
- **Stronger transparency** - Know what your security software is doing
- **Better tools** - Modern, efficient, and actually useful
- **Community-driven philosophy** - Built by and for the people who use it

To give SysDefense a unique identity, each tool will be represented by a custom anime-themed character.

## Why I'm Building This

Security software is often:
- Expensive
- Closed-off
- Bloated with features nobody asked for

I believe it can be better, more affordable, more transparent, and more feature-rich. 

SysDefense is an opportunity for both myself and others to learn how real security tools work while contributing to something that could make a real impact. Even if we never rival the big players, we'll learn a ton and build something useful along the way.

## Core Pillars

SysDefense is built on four principles:

1. **Community**
2. **Security**
3. **Education**
4. **Affordability**

## The Suite

### Always Free and Open Source

Four foundational tools that will always be 100% open source:

**Note:** These names may change
- **WARDEN** - System Audit and Educator *(MVP Available Now)*
- **ORION** - Malware Scanner *(In Development)*
- **SENTRY** - Network Security *(Planned)*
- **VAULT** - Password Manager *(Planned)*

### Maybe Someday

Three additional tools I want to build, though I'm still figuring out if they're feasible or if they can be fully open source:

- **GUARDIAN** - Ransomware Protection
- **SENTINEL** - Suspicious Activity Monitor
- **VOICE** - AI...Something (I'm not sure on this one yet)

## The Money Talk

Look, I need to be upfront about this. This is probably years away, but if SysDefense gains traction, I want to create a GUI version and charge for it. Here's why:

**The CLI will always be free.** Period. But a GUI takes significant time to build and maintain. By charging for it, I can:
- Work on this full-time instead of squeezing it into evenings and weekends
- Give back to the community through bug bounties and competitions
- Actually sustain the project long-term

If we get there, **all revenue will be public**. You'll know exactly what comes in and where it goes. Current plan:

**Starting out:**
- 60% - Supports me (so I can go full-time)
- 30% - Community (bounties, competitions, giveaways)
- 10% - Charity

**Once we hit $150k/year:**
- 40% - Me (sustainable full-time income)
- 40% - Community (bigger bounties and events)
- 20% - Charity

Pricing would likely be:
- CLI: Free forever
- GUI Standard ($10/mo or $100/yr): All open-source tools with a nice interface
- GUI Premium ($30/mo or $300/yr): Everything + the closed-source tools

This could all change. We're nowhere near this yet. But I want to be transparent about where this could go.

## Community Plans

If SysDefense succeeds, I want to do cool stuff with the community:
- Bug bounties for security researchers
- Coding and Art competitions
- Giveaways
- Recognition for contributors
- And loads more

If it does really well, I'd like to make a Comedy/Educational/Action anime of SysDefense characters. Though that's my own desires.

All of this depends on whether people actually use and care about SysDefense.

## Real Talk

I'm writing this as a dream, knowing full well it might never be as successful as I'd like. **And I'm okay with that.** 

I'm doing this mainly to:
- Improve my own skills
- Learn how security tools actually work
- Teach others through my mistakes and successes
- Build something useful, even if it's just for a small group

If even 100 people use WARDEN and learn something about Windows security, that's a win.

If you believe in this vision or just want to support the work, **[star the repo](https://github.com/AnimeForLife191/sysdefense)**. It helps more than you know.

**Current Status:** WARDEN v0.1.0 is available now. ORION development starting soon.
