# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

We're not perfect and there will probably be bugs and security flaws. **If** you find any of the following:

### 🔒 Report Privately (Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability"):

- Bugs that could crash, hang, or corrupt data when processing malicious input
- Issues that could leak sensitive system information (passwords, system data, etc.)
- Vulnerabilities that could allow privilege escalation
- Design flaws that undermine security guarantees

I'll work on fixing them promptly and (if you want) give you credit for finding them.

### 📝 Otherwise, just make a public issue!

For feature requests, bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates, or general questions:

Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AnimeForLife191/Shuhari-CyberForge/issues). We welcome all contributions!
